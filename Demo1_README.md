# Team22
Our program is a game of minesweeper. It contains a board filled with bombs and numbers that correspond to where the bombs are located in the 
lower board.
In the github repository, every file is part of Demo1. 
There are no references in our program.
This includes Bombs1, Player, PLayerTest, Grids, Lower, and Upper.
The main class needed to run the program is the class PlayerTest, as it has the main method. 
In order to compile the program, every file must be together and it should be run through PlayerTest.
