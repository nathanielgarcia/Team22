Our program is a game of minesweeper. It contains a board filled with bombs and numbers that correspond to where the bombs are located in the 
lower board.
In the github repository, every file is part of Iteration 3. 
There are no references in our program.

Iteration 3 includes Bombs, Grids, Lower, Player, Main and Upper as the components that make up the logic of the game as well as the ability to run the game without javaFX. The components that make up the javaFX application include Main, StartUpMenuController, NoviceBoardController, Minesweep9Controller, and Minesweep12Controller.

The main class used to run the program is the Main class, as it imports the necessary files from java to run javaFX and conatins the main method, which allows the program to run.

In order to compile the program all the java files that are in the Iteration 2 branch are required.
